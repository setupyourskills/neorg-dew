# neorg-dew

ðŸŒ¿ **neorg-dew** is a collection of minimal, purpose-driven extensions for [Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg), designed around a personal and efficient workflow.

Each submodule depends on the core **neorg-dew** module, which provides essential base libraries and utilities.  
This design keeps individual modules lightweight and focused, avoiding unnecessary code duplication.

You can use just one module, combine several, or build your own system around them.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A functional installation of [Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg) is required for this module to work.

### Using Lazy.nvim

```lua
{ "setupyourskills/neorg-dew" }
```

## Available submodules

ðŸš§ **This project is under active and continuous development.**  
Currently, a few modules are available and in progress:

| Module                | Status       | Description                                                    |
|-----------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [neorg-dew-crumb](https://github.com/setupyourskills/neorg-dew-crumb)     | ðŸ”§ In dev    | Displays breadcrumbs from headings and the Title                 |
| [neorg-dew-catngo](https://github.com/setupyourskills/neorg-dew-catngo)    | ðŸ”§ In dev    | Quick and simple note picker focused on category-based selection |

## Collaboration and Compatibility

This project embraces collaboration and may build on external modules created by other Neorg members,  
which will be tested regularly to ensure they remain **functional** and **compatible** with the latest versions of Neorg and Neovim.  

## Why `dew`?

Like morning dew, itâ€™s **subtle**, **natural**, and brief, yet vital and effective for any workflow.
